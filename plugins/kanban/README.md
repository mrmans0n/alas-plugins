# Kanban

A board of task cards for a project. Starting a card creates a worktree and
starts an agent with the card's prompt; the card then follows its session
across the board. It uses plugin API 3 (view tabs, `task/start` and storage)
and is the reference plugin for that API.

## Build and install

From the repository root:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
plugins/kanban/build.sh
```

`build.sh` works from any directory and installs into
`~/Library/Application Support/Alas/Plugins/kanban`. Set
`ALAS_APP_SUPPORT_DIR` to install into an isolated Alas profile instead.

Then turn on **Settings → Debug → Experimental → Plugins** (it only shows when
`~/.alas/.debug` exists), open **Settings → Plugins**, click **Approve…** on
Kanban, and open **View → Plugins → Board**.

## Using the board

Columns: **Backlog**, **Running**, **Needs you**, **Review** and **Done**.

- Add a card at the top of Backlog: type the prompt and press ⌘Return. Its
  first line becomes the card's title.
- **Start** creates a new worktree (branch `task/<title>`) and starts the
  project's default agent there with the prompt. Every Start makes a new
  worktree. If the start fails, the card stays in Backlog with the reason;
  Start retries.
- A started card follows its session: running → Running, waiting for input or
  permission → Needs you, idle or ended → Review. Click it to open the session.
- **Move to** moves a card by hand. Moving to Done or Backlog stops it
  following its session; Running, Needs you and Review keep following. A card
  that was never started can only move to Backlog or Done.

The board is saved per project in the plugin's storage and survives restarts.
If Alas quits while a card is starting, the card can stay in Backlog even
though its worktree and agent were created; starting it again makes a second
worktree.

The board holds at most 50 cards and 96,000 bytes of title and prompt text.
Alas gives every plugin call a fixed fuel budget, and loading, saving and
drawing the board costs fuel per card and per byte; at these caps the costliest
call stays under half the budget. Past a cap, adding a card removes the oldest
Done cards to make room. When removing every Done card would not be enough,
the card is not added. Backlog says so once the board is nearly full.
